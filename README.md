# hardware-features

> A KiCad hardware design repository with automated CI for schematic rendering, visual diffing, ERC/DRC, AI review, and release management.

---

## Quick start

1. **Clone with submodules** — the shared component library is a git submodule and must be checked out at the same time:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rockett90/hardware-features.git
   ```
2. **Open in KiCad** — open `features/<feature-name>/<feature-name>.kicad_pro`. See [docs/versions.md](docs/versions.md) for the required KiCad version.
3. **Create a branch and open a draft PR** — CI runs on every push. Open the PR as a draft immediately after your first push so checks can start running.
4. **Use slash commands** during review to trigger CI actions — see [Slash commands](#slash-commands) below.

## Toolchain & versions

See [docs/versions.md](docs/versions.md) for all pinned tool and dependency versions.

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| KiCad | Pinned — do not upgrade individually, coordinate with the lead |
| KiBot | Via Docker (pinned SHA) — used in CI only, no local install needed |
| kicad-happy | Deterministic schematic and PCB analysis |
| Python | Required for local script use — minimum version in [docs/versions.md](docs/versions.md) |
| Pillow / cairosvg / sexpdata | Required for `kicad-visual-diff` locally — pinned in `scripts/ci/requirements.txt` |
| release-please | Manages `CHANGELOG.md` and GitHub Releases automatically |

tests/            — Tests for CI scripts and tooling
```

## Slash commands

Post a slash command as a PR comment to trigger CI actions. Commands require **write access** to the repository.

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/render` | Export schematic as SVG — readable without KiCad |
| `/kicad-diff` | Generate a four-column visual diff of schematic (and PCB) changes vs base branch |
| `/ai-review` | Run AI schematic review — posts findings as a PR comment |
| `/erc` | Run Electrical Rules Check — informational, does not block merge |
| `/drc` | Run Design Rules Check — informational, does not block merge |

The dispatcher reacts with 👀 immediately on receipt, ✅ on success, ❌ on failure.

## Branch naming

| Type | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Concept exploration | `concept/<feature>` |
| Initialise new feature | `init/<feature>` |
| Design work | `artifact/<feature>/<desc>` |
| Design work with ticket | `artifact/<feature>/<desc-HW-123>` |
| IVV finding | `finding/<feature>/<N>-<desc>` |
| CDR sign-off | `signoff/<feature>/cdr` |
| TRR sign-off | `signoff/<feature>/trr` |
| Re-TRR | `signoff/<feature>/trr-N` |
| Library change | `library/<desc>` |
| Tooling / docs | `chore/<desc>` |

CI validates every PR branch name. A non-matching name fails the "Validate branch name" check and cannot merge until corrected.

## Feature lifecycle (overview)

1. **Init PR** (`init/<feature>`) — scaffolds the full feature directory structure automatically on merge.
2. **Design work** (`artifact/<feature>/...` PRs) — schematic and PCB changes, one feature per PR.
3. **Use slash commands** during review: `/render`, `/kicad-diff`, `/ai-review`, `/erc`, `/drc`.
4. **CDR sign-off** (`signoff/<feature>/cdr`) — gate-check CI must pass before merge.
5. **TRR sign-off** (`signoff/<feature>/trr`) — gate-check CI must pass before merge.
6. **Release** — managed automatically by release-please; never close a Release PR manually.
